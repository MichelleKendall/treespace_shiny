Differences between the "treespace_shiny" app and the app bundled in the R package:

ui.R
Extra "start.html" tab panel
Download handlers for saving in 3D



server.R
Responses to saving in 3D
DengueTrees.RData is called directly rather than via the package because it contains only 300 rather than 500 trees
