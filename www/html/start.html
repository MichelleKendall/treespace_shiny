<h2> Welcome to the <font color="#6C6CC4"> <i>treespace</i> </font> server. </h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3><font color="#6C6CC4"> <i>treespace</i> </font> is an R package for the comparison of phylogenetic trees.
This web interface provides easy access to the resources implemented in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treespace/index.html" target="_blank">the package</a>.
<br>
<br>
The <font color="#6C6CC4"> Help </font> tab explains everything in more detail.
Briefly:
<br>
<br>
 <ul>
  <li>Get started with the <font color="#6C6CC4"> Tree landscape explorer </font> tab. Here you can use the example datasets of Dengue fever trees or woodmice trees, or upload your own trees. You can visualise the relative distances between trees in 2D or 3D according to various metrics, and colour them by type (e.g. coloured by gene) or by statistical clustering methods. </li>
  <br>
  <li>View individual trees in the <font color="#6C6CC4"> Tree viewer </font> tab, including the overall median tree according to the Kendall Colijn metric, and a median tree per cluster if statistical clusters have been identified. </li>
  <br>
    <li>View collections of trees superimposed on each other in the <font color="#6C6CC4"> densiTree viewer </font> tab. This can give an idea of how similar or otherwise the trees are. </li>
</ul>
  <br>
